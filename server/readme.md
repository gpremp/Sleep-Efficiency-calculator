## Steps to run Server

You will need to create a database in MongoDB called `sleep-info-database`

The MongoDB database connection string should be provided in the .env file in the root of the server under the key name `DB`

To install all dependencies on the server, run the `npm install` command

Start the node.js server with the command `npm start`
